World Bank GDP Data Fetcher

Introduction

This is a personal project I undertook over the weekend to both revisit Java and OOP concepts and to satisfy my curiosity about the World Bank API.

This program fetches and displays the GDP of various countries as a percentage of the world's GDP. The data is sourced directly from the World Bank API and can be displayed for a range of years specified by the user. Result is sorted from highest to lowest based on last year in the range provided; countries with the highest last year GDP at the top.


Setup

1. Navigate to the directory: target

2. Execute the jar file and specify the range of years:

java -jar worldbank-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --from-year [start-year] --to-year [end-year]


Assumptions
The data from the World Bank API is accurate and up-to-date.
The --from-year should be less than --to-year.
